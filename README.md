## üöÄ Getting Started

This project is split into two separate repositories: one for the backend server and one for the frontend client. You will need to clone and run both to use the application locally.

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18 or newer recommended)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)
- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/download/) or another SQL database supported by Sequelize.
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)

### 1. Backend Setup (Server)

First, set up the server which will run your API.

```bash
# 1. Clone the backend repository into a folder named 'book-web-server'
git clone https://github.com/Maham-1234/book-web.git book-web-server
cd book-web-server

# 2. Install dependencies
npm install

# 3. Create the environment file and fill it out
#    (See "Backend Environment Variables" section below for details)
cp .env.example .env

# 4. Set up the database
#    - Make sure your database server (PostgreSQL) is running.
#    - Create a new database with the name you specified in your .env file.
#    - Run the Sequelize migrations to create all the tables.
npx sequelize-cli db:migrate

# 5. Start the backend server
npm run dev
```

The backend server should now be running, typically on **`http://localhost:3000`**.

### 2. Frontend Setup (Client)

Next, in a **separate terminal window**, set up the React client application.

```bash
# 1. Clone the frontend repository into a folder named 'book-web-client'
git clone https://github.com/Maham-1234/book-web-client-1.git book-web-client
cd book-web-client

# 2. Install dependencies
npm install

# 3. Create the environment file and fill it out
#    (See "Frontend Environment Variables" section below for details)
cp .env.example .env

# 4. Start the frontend development server
npm run dev

```

The frontend application should now be running, typically on **`http://localhost:5173`**. You can now access the application in your browser.
